Encryption algorithm  used is AES 128 with SHA-1

Programs for encypting or decrypting need command line arguments as inputs. 

The java code is located in "java/fast impelemenation"
All java code are precompiled and are ready to be excuted using php scripts Enc.php for encryption and Dec.php for decryption.

Regarding php code:
Enc.php runs the runE.java file and command line arguments can be used. 
Dec.php runs the runD.java file and command line arguments can be used.

runtime of code running on the client side takes about 0.4 seconds to execute.
runtime of code running on the server side takes about 3.6 seconds to execute, which means we need to upgrade our server's capabilites to improve the runtime of our program...
