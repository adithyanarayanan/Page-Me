# pager
Rekindling memories by developing a pager web app, made for the nostalgic


We as a team are lookingto recreate what using a pager feels like. 

We are creating a an android application that works exactly like one, over the duration of this semester. 

The main aim behind this is to create a messaging application that can send only numbers, using only

the direction control buttons. We will do server and client side programming with a realistic pager like UI. 

The user shall be able to call other numbers, strictly 9 digited, using the app and the reciever's app shall sound a notification 
and shall display the number from which the call is recieved. 

The server of course shall help facilitate the communication.
